## Interested in JHC?

Thank you for considering sending your camper to Junior High Camp! A fun-filled and spiritual week lies ahead. We have worked hard to create an extremely welcoming environment that celebrates the participation of everyone who wishes to attend. Our counselors have undergone training focused on how to include those at camp for their first time, those who maybe miss home a little more than others, and how to make it the highlight of your camper’s summer. Most churches also send a youth leader to support the adult presence and provide a familiar face for our campers- we encourage you to talk to your youth leaders about who will be representing your church this year and for them to share their own camp experiences! If you have any outstanding questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our Directing Team, whose contact information can be found on the registration packet attached here. We can’t wait to see you at Junior High Camp!
