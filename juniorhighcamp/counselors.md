## To Our Counselors

Thank you for even considering applying! You are the heart of camp and there is no camp without you. We know you’re all busy with the various activities and responsibilities in your lives, so please talk to a director if you have any qualms about how much time will need to be dedicated to camp- we want to work with you to make it a possibility!

## To Our Counselor Parents

As former counselors ourselves, we know just how crucial parental support is to our success as a counselor and we thank you for being the support system of this year’s counselors. We want to make sure to highlight the details of the areas parents tend to support the most- namely financially and with transportation- and to encourage you to reach out to our Directing Team if you have any questions or concerns!

- Financially:
  - Counselor fee is 75% of camper registration
  - Counselors are financially responsible for providing materials for their growth groups and cabins
- Transportation:
  - Counselors are not allowed to drive themselves to and from non-local camp meetings
  - Please note the All-Cal and Post-Camp dates and consider whether or not you will be able to assist with transportation at least once- you are highly relied upon for transportation for these meetings
