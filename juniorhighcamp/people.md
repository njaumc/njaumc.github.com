Being at camp for Darrell is truly a blessing to see the campers and counselors grow throughout the week. It is with Darrell's passion to give back to JHC so that the future campers and counselors can experience God's amazing love as he has.

      Darin has been a part of JHC for five years: two as a camper and three as a counselor. His favorite thing about JHC is that he gets to spend a week surrounded by so many inspiring people simply because they all share the love of God. He is blessed to be able to give back to a camp that nurtures campers' and counselors' faith through fellowship and praise.

     Justin Jue is known for his ability to eat copious amounts of food, and his endless energy. He attends Aldersgate United Methodist Church where a few of the older youth encouraged him to go to his first year of Junior High Camp in 2006. In later years he drifted away from the church, but during his junior year of high school, Jayme Nakamura and Colin Chang told him he should apply to be Junior High Camp counselor. Junior High Camp is where Justin Jue first connected with God, and since then he has not regretted going to Junior High Camp as a camper and a counselor, and now as a Director.
