## Our Mission

To introduce youth to Christ, nurture their faith and send them forth as Christian disciples and leaders for the transformation of their community and world.

## Camping Ministry Principles and Core Values
- The foundation of our camping ministries is the inclusion and celebration that all people are created, valued and loved by God.
- To love people of all ethnicities, gender identities and gender expressions, sexual orientation or experiences of faith
- To offer a community of acceptance, support, guidance and fellowship that strengthens the foundations for their journey
- To raise awareness and encourage faithful response to social injustice in our community and world

## Non-Discrimination Policy
 
Our emphasis for ministry has and continues to be an outreach to youth and young adults from our NJAUMC churches, however, all of our camps and their activities are available to all persons without regard to race, color, national origin, gender identities and gender expression, sexual orientation or disability. 

The foundation of our camping ministries is the inclusion and celebration that all people are created, valued and loved by God. Our camps do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, and bullying against any person for any reasonâ€”for example, because of age, ancestry, color, disability or handicap, national origin, race, religion, gender, sexual or affectional orientation, gender identity, or appearance.

We are connected to the United Methodist Church through the National Japanese American United Methodist Caucus, governed by the NJAUMC camping board.  We strive on bringing the presence of Christ and the church through the existence of these camps.
