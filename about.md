##Our Mission

To introduce youth to Christ, nurture their faith and send them forth as Christian disciples and leaders for the transformation of their community and world. 

##Camping Ministry Principles and Core Values
- To support and encourage youth to actively participate and be in relationship to their local church community.
- To love people of all ethnicities, genders, sexual orientation or experiences of faith.
- To offer a community of acceptance, support, guidance and fellowship that strengthens the foundation for their journey.
- To raise awareness and encourage faithful response to social injustice in our community and world.
