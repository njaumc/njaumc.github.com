##Our Mission

We desire to introduce youth to Christ, nurture their faith and send them forth as Christian disciples and leaders for the transformation of their community and world.

##Our Connection
 
We are connected to the United Methodist Church through the National Japanese American United Methodist Caucus, governed by the NJAUMC camping board.  We strive on bringing the presence of Christ and the church through the existence of these camps.
