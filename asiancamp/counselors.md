The application process will consist of 2 components:

1. A completed [counselor application]({{site.asian_camp_counselor_app}}) and camp registration, including signature of endorsement from your Pastor.
2. A letter of recommendation from your Pastor
This application is intended to help the Design Team assess your spiritual gifts in order to assemble amazing counseling teams for small
groups, large group activities, and cabins. Please do your best to complete it thoroughly and honestly. The completed application and
letter of recommendation must in the hands of the Design Team by February 17, 2013. We are taking the counselor application
and its deadline very serious this year because we need to schedule Skype/phone conversations! 

For any questions about the application process, meeting dates/locations, or Asian Camp in general please contact any Design Team
member.
