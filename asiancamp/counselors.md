##Join Us!

The Camp Directors are excited for you to join them in this opportunity to be with God! We pray to allow Him to work through all of us to plan another meaningful year for the spiritual formation of our youth and local churches.

Serving as a Camp Counselor is big responsibility and an experience that we hope you find graceful, challenging, and purposeful.

If you are interested in serving Christ with us this year, we need you to ask yourself these 6 questions:

1. Are you entering your 3rd year of college or older?
2. Do you have experience working with youth?
3. Are you actively serving in your local church?
4. Has Jesus been working in your heart?
5. Can you attend the week of Camp?
6. Can you also attend Regional Trainings #1, #2, and Counselor Retreats #1, #2? (See counselor training dates below)

If you answered YES to those questions, we would love for you to apply to join our STAFF!
