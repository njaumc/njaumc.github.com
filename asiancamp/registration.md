## Theme: Self(Less)

In a “Selfie-filled” world, we are taught to be proud of ourselves and our accomplishments, and we’ve learned to put our value in everything that society has deemed important. However, God calls us to, in fact, pursue “Less” of ourselves and “More” of Him every day.  This week we will be reflecting on how we can live a more God-centered life and what applications that has for where we are right now.
