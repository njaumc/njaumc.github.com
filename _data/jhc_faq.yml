- question: Is there financial assistance available for the registration fee?
  answer: "Yes, the National Japanese American United Methodist Caucus offers scholarships to campers each year.  The scholarship application will be available at the same time camper registration is. Scholarship applications will be released with Camper Registration forms."

- question: What does a day at camp look like?
  answer: "Each morning we have worship, a message from the clergy and small group time when two counselors lead activities and discussions to unfold the day’s theme.  Each full day includes all three meals, “rest period” after lunch to recharge, “free time” before dinner to explore individual interests and campfire to close each night.  In between all these traditions are packed with various activities and workshops led by different staff members that correspond to daily themes.  The counselors most directly lead the campers and share JHC traditions, notably: Water Day, Messy Day, Etiquette Workshops and the ‘Sharing Show.’"

- question: What if I’ve never been to church before or I’m still exploring my faith?
  answer: "No worries at all because Junior High Camp is the perfect place to do just that.  The daily themes and messages are directed for the Junior High aged audience to most simply explain and reveal Christian values.  Junior High Camp provides the comforting environment for self-reflection and to answer any and all questions you may have."

- question: What if I’ve never been away from home before?
  answer: "Junior High Camp is the first time for many campers to be away from home.  The overwhelming love and comfort of being at camp often replaces homesickness.  We understand that overnight camp can be difficult for the first time, so there are counselors fully participating in each activity alongside campers.  With a 2:1 ratio of children to staff members, the directors and adult staff, in addition, are always available to address any concern.  Many of us camp veterans would express that camp is where we feel most at home, and actually being away from the norm gives us the space for personal growth and exploration."

- question: How can I contact my child at camp?
  answer: "We encourage relatives and friends to send campers mail throughout the week (camp address can be found in registration packet).  However, to fully experience each moment of camp and with limited service, we are usually not on our phones or computers throughout the day.  In case of an emergency, the direct phone line to the campsite is always available."

- question: What can I expect to get out of camp?
  answer: "Regardless of your religious background, you will be able to leave camp with a greater understanding of God’s unconditional love and thought-provoking challenges for individual growth.  Our hope is that you will grow spiritually and learn what it means to be a child of God.  We hope that you will find the same comfort and support system many of us have found in camp that reaches far beyond the one week of camp."

- question: What if I don’t know anyone else going to camp this year?
  answer: "That’s totally okay as many of us have met our lifelong best friends through camp.  You will have the opportunity to meet almost everyone at camp throughout the week, starting as soon as you get there.  Coming from all different areas of the West Coast, it’s not uncommon to go into camp not knowing anyone and leaving with new friends and often relationships founded on deep and meaningful connections.  The term “camp family” is true to the welcoming and accepting people who want to share their love of camp with others."

- question: What if I’m not in Junior High School anymore but still want to get involved in camp?
  answer: 'There is actually a camp for high school and early college students, Asian American Summer Camp.  We are also looking for committed individuals to serve as counselors at Junior High Camp.  More information can be found on the <a href="/assets/docs/JHCCounselorApplication2016.pdf">counselor application</a>.'

- question: What adults are available at camp?
  answer: "The adult staff consists of the directors, a group of counselors, clergy members of NJAUMC churches, the camp nurse and a number of adult volunteers who stay throughout the entire week to support the leadership of camp."

- question: What can I do about medications or any special assistance I may need?
  answer: "We always have a Camp Nurse on site to address any medical needs.  The Camp Nurse facilitates medication daily to the campers, and the entire directing team and Camping Board will do whatever we can to provide any necessary special assistance."
