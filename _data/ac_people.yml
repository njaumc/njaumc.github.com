  blurb: 'Before junior high, I was the typical child that went to church because my parents went to church.  Then camp was introduced to my life and has changed me since.  Asian Camp specifically has given me a new perspective on my life and has given me lifetime friendships as well.  I keep finding myself coming back to camp in some way, shape, or form, even when I thought my time was done.  God works in mysterious ways, and I know that I am just here to share and spread His love and pay it forward.  Love God, Love One Another.'

  scripture: "1st John 4:7-12"
  blurb: "What can I say about AC? Well one thing that always amazes me about AC is that the 51 weeks of the rest of the year feel less special. Despite all the stress, hours, and work designing AC takes, in the end it's always worth the effort. For me, it's always been the highlight of my summer as a camper, counselor, and now as a director. I hope that camp'a legacy will continue to grow amongst the newer generations. It's amazing to see people grow up within camp and worth all the time in the world."
