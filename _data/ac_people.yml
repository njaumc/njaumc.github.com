  why: 'Camp has always been my favorite week of the summer. It is the perfect place to take a deep breath, and concentrate on my relationship with God. It serves as a place for me to recognize my weaknesses and an opportunity to strengthen my faith. The people I have met serve as life-long friends and a community I can always count on. I continue coming back to camp because it is a huge part of who I am today. I want to give back all that camp has provided me. The experiences are indescribable and my hope is to provide just that, for the generations to come. '
