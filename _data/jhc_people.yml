  header: "A biography of Camille Obata as told by Stephanie"
  blurb: "Camille Obata is a 3rd year student at UC Riverside who really loves grapefruit juice. This is her second year directing and hails from Buena Vista UMC in Alameda. Aside from being a Junior High Camp director, Camille is very active in her school’s Nikkei Student Union as the social chair. She can also play basketball (a huge feat in my opinion). If she had a favorite kind of cheese, my guess is that it would be a gouda one."

- name: Kelli Yamaguma
  header: "A biography of Kelli Josephine Yamaguma as told by Kirk based on true life events as well as a brief interview taken out of context"
  blurb: "Kelli Josephine Yamaguma is a 3rd year at CSU Fullerton. Her now everlasting relationship to the njaumc camps origins from her childhood where she grew up at Aldersgate UMC. This will be her first year as Director Support. When she's not busy with her schooling she enjoys culinary activities, like eating, or watching videos of dogs. These fun filled activities however don't distract her in any way from pursuing her dream job of one day becoming a professional puppy petter (PPP). Her love for dogs is unparallelled by anyone. She claims she has actually potty trained 2 hypothetical dogs; Amazing! Kelli can almost always be seen smiling or laughing due to her unusual sense of humor driven by puns. Her sense of humor might be explained through her spirit celeb. She claims to be most aligned with spongebob squarepants on an extreme metaphysical level. Her similarities with spongebob don't end there though; she has some sea stories that will leave your jaw dropped and your nose plugged. For example one time she somehow managed to step on a sea urchin and then had to soak her foot in vinegar. With vinegar scented feet its no surprise that she has an impeccable knack for scents with her favorite scent being corrugated cardboard, which she picked over sheet metal which came in a close second. Lastly she loves being a carnivore for the following three reasons: KBBQ, Corndogs, and meat is good. "
